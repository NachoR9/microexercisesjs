# The word exist or not.

Given a string of arbitrary length with any ascii characters. Write a function to determine whether
the string contains the whole word "English".

The order of characters is important -- a string "abcEnglishdef" is correct but "abcnEglishsef" is not
correct.

Upper or lower case letter does not matter -- "eNglisH" is also correct.

Return value as boolean values, true for the string to contains "English", false for it does not.

# Reversing words.

 You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:
As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

Example ( --> )

"Hello World" --> "World Hello" 
"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"

# Simple calculator

You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.

Your function will accept three arguments:
The first and second argument should be numbers.
The third argument should represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.

If the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown value" must be returned.
